Figuring out how to work around VS Code and GitHub.
Right now using GitHub Desktop application to see and save my respo locally on my pcs - that way I can use VS Code and use an extension called Live Server - whereas I can see my changes live on a remote window/local website each time I save.
I tried to use Codespace extension, where it launches a Remote Window and whenever a change is committed within a branch, it goes straight to the GitHub.com respo. But I was not able to use Live Server-extension whilst having Codespace open, so I had to find another solution.

     Trying to figure out how to commit changes to a branch. - Just figuring things out:
        Do I just need to save things on VS Code, then just Commit it on GitHub Desktop Application
